This is a [Flow](http://onflow.org/) project bootstrapped with [flow-app-scafold](https://github.com/flyinglimao/flow-app-scaffold).

## Getting Started

First, install packages for sub-projects:

```bash
cd api # and web
yarn
```

If you had installed [Flow CLI](https://github.com/onflow/flow-cli), start the emulator.
```bash
flow emulator
```

At the meanwhile, you may want to open other 2 terminals and start api server and front-end app.
```bash
# terminal 1
cd api && yarn start
# terminal 2
cd web && yarn start
```
